FATODE contains a set of integrators to solve ordinary differential system 
y'=f(t,y) with capabilities of direct and adjoint sensitivity analysis. 
FATODE is implemented in FORTRAN90, and has been tested with the following 
compilers: Portland group's pgf90, Intel's ifort, Lahey's lf95, Sun's sunf90, 
gfortran, Absoft. 

FATODE contains the following directory structure:

    FATODE/README      general instructions
    FATODE/FWD         forward model integrators   
    FATODE/ADJ         adjoint model integrators
    FATODE/TLM         tangent linear model integrators
    FATODE/LSS_LIBS    lib files of linear solvers 
    FATODE/EXAMPLES    example programs

FATODE implementation requires BLAS and LAPACK libraries. For solution of
linear systems arised in the integration, FATODE provides options to use BLAS/
LAPACK routines (with macro definition -DFULL_ALGEBRA) and to use sparse linear
solvers such as UMFPACK (-DSPARSE_UMF) and SuperLU (-DSPARSE_LU). If sparse 
linear solvers are needed, the FATODE code must be linked with corresponding 
(static) libraries for the linear solvers. For installation instuctions of 
UMFPACK and SuperLU, please refer to their websites. 
UMFPACK can be accessed at:
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/
SuperLU can be accessed at:
http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/

Since UMFPACK and SuperLU are written in C, wrappers for calling C routines from
FORTRAN are needed. They can be found in the original packages of UMFPACK and 
SuperLU. For convenience, they are also included in FATODE/LSS_LIBS directory as well as makefiles to generate object files which can be linked to FATODE code. Make sure to set the installation PATH correctly in the makefiles if you need to regenerate the object files.

For usage of FATODE, please refer to the example programs containing drivers and makefiles which can be used as templates.
